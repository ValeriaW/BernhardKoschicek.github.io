### What is the Digital Humanities?
> > Digital Humanities refers to new modes of scholarship
and institutional units for collaborative, transdisciplinary,
and computationally engaged research,
teaching, and publication.

> > Digital Humanities is less a unified field than an
array of convergent practices that explore a universe
in which print is no longer the primary medium in
which knowledge is produced and disseminated.
Digital tools, techniques, and media have
expanded traditional concepts of knowledge in the
arts, humanities and social sciences, but Digital
Humanities is not solely “about” the digital (in the
sense of limiting its scope to the study of digital
culture). Nor is Digital Humanities only “about” the
humanities as traditionally understood since it argues
for a remapping of traditional practices. Rather,
Digital Humanities is defined by the opportunities
and challenges that arise from the conjunction of the
term digital with the term humanities to form a new
collective singular.

> > The opportunities include redrawing the boundary
lines among the humanities, the social sciences,
the arts, and the natural sciences; expanding the
audience and social impact of scholarship in the
humanities; developing new forms of inquiry and
knowledge production and reinvigorating ones that
have fallen by the wayside; training future generations
of humanists through hands-on, project-based
learning as a complement to classroom-based learning;
and developing practices that expand the scope,
enhance the quality, and increase the visibility of
humanistic research.

> > The challenges include addressing fundamental
questions such as: How can skills traditionally used
in the humanities be reshaped in multimedia terms?
How and by whom will the contours of cultural and
historical memory be defined in the digital era?
How might practices such as digital storytelling
coincide with or diverge from oral or print-based
storytelling? What is the place of humanitas in a
networked world?
